# Automated-Watering-Project-For-Houseplants
•	Created an automated watering system for house plants using an Arduino Grove microcontroller board, integrating sensors and actuators such as a soil moisture sensor to monitor dryness and activate watering through a motorized mechanism when needed


•	Applied problem-solving skills to address sensor inaccuracies by implementing a filtering solution with a defined threshold, ensuring that only multiple consistent readings triggered the watering process, while using Object-Oriented Programming in Java to create a reliable and efficient control system
